# Dynamic Deadline Automation with Asana


This project automates the assignment of due dates to tasks based on priority and extends due dates for tasks in the "In Progress" section when a high-priority task is moved to that section.

## Features
- Assigns initial due dates based on task priority:
  - Low: 14 days from the present date.
  - Mid: 7 days from the present date.
  - High: 2 days from the present date.
- Automatically extends due dates for all tasks in the "In Progress" section by 2 days when a high-priority task is moved there.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or above
- Code Editor(VSCode Preferred)
- An Asana account and an Asana Personal Access Token(see instructions below)

### Get you Project ID, In Progress section ID and IDs for priority Mapping:
1. First get your workspace id: In the below command replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the actual ASANA API key. Running the above command will give you an id(gid), that gid is your WORKSPACE_ID.

   ```sh
   curl --location --request GET "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces" --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   ```
  
2. Get `ASANA_PROJECT_ID`: Replace the `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with actual values in the below command. Running the below command will give you the gid, That gid is your `ASANA_PROJECT_ID`.

    ```sh
    curl --location --request GET "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces/YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID/projects" --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

3. Get `IN_PROGRESS_SECTION_ID`: Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with actual values in the below command. Running the below command will give you gids for all the sections, the gid associated with In Progress section is your `IN_PROGRESS_SECTION_ID`.

    ```sh
    curl --location --request GET "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sections" --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

4. Get IDs for different priority levels(Low, Mid and High): Kindly replace {your_personal_access_token} and {project_id} with actual values in the below command. When you run the command below, you will get IDs for different priority levels. Kindly update those IDs in `webhook_listener.py`

    ```sh
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_personal_access_token}" https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/{project_id}/custom_field_settings | python -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin);       print([{opt['gid']: opt['name']} for field in data['data'] if field['custom_field']['name'] == 'Priority' for opt in field['custom_field']['enum_options']])"
    ```

After you get  `ASANA_PROJECT_ID` and `IN_PROGRESS_SECTION_ID`, update those values in `.env` file.

### Steps to setup ngrok:
1. Install ngrok
    ```sh
    pip install ngrok
    ```

2. [ngrok account setup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
   Sign up or Sign in using your email or Google, Agree to Terms and click Create Account

3. It will ask you to add multi-factor authentication, you can add it or skip it.
4. Click continue if skipped.
5. Now it will ask you some details, you can provide the datails or simply click continue.
6. Navigate [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken), copy your authtoken
7. Run the below command, replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with actual authtoken.
   ```sh
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the `webhook_listener.py` to start the Flask server that listens for Asana webhook events:
   ```sh
   python -u webhook_listener.py
   ```
2. Open another terminal window and run ngrok. (Replace the Port number 5000 with actual port number where your flask server is running if it is not running on port 5000).
   ```sh
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
3. Running the above command will give you a public url, copy that url and replace it in the place of `<your-ngrok-url>` at line 12 of `create_webhook.py` and save the file.

4. Run the `create_webhook.py` to create a webhook that monitors the asana for any events and sends it to Flask server:
   ```sh
   python -u create_webhook.py
   ```
3. Add tasks to Asana and test the automation by assigning priorities and moving tasks to the "In Progress" section.
