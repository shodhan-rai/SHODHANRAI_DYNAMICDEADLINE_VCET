# Dynamic Deadline Automation


This project automates the assignment of due dates to tasks based on priority and extends due dates for tasks in the "In Progress" section when a high-priority task is moved to that section.

## Features
- Assigns initial due dates based on task priority:
  - Low: 14 days from the present date.
  - Mid: 7 days from the present date.
  - High: 2 days from the present date.
- Automatically extends due dates for all tasks in the "In Progress" section by 2 days when a high-priority task is moved there.
- Reduces due dates for tasks in 'In Progress' section by 2 days when high priority task is moved out of 'In Progress' section.
- Prevents redundant due date extensions and due date reductions.

## Prerequisites

### Priority Level IDs:
Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with actual values in the below command. Kindly update those IDs in `webhook_listener.py` at line 12.

  ```sh
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/custom_field_settings | python -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin);       print([{opt['gid']: opt['name']} for field in data['data'] if field['custom_field']['name'] == 'Priority' for opt in field['custom_field']['enum_options']])"
  ```

## 2. Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and place the below content:

   ```sh
   ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>
   ASANA_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
   IN_PROGRESS_SECTION_ID=<your_in_progress_section_id>
   ASANA_API_URL=https://app.asana.com/api/1.0
   WEBHOOK_URL=<your_ngrok_url>
   ```

2. Replace `<your_personal_access_token>`, `<your_project_id>` and `<your_in_progress_section_id>` with the correct values and save the file.

3. Set system environment variables (Windows):

   ```sh
   setx ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN "your-personal-access-token"
   ```
   ```sh
   setx ASANA_PROJECT_ID "your-project-id"
   ```
   

## 3. ngrok Configuration
### Install ngrok:
  ```sh
  pip install ngrok
  ```
### Set up authentication:

1. [ngrok account setup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)

5. Navigate [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken), copy your authtoken
6. Run the below command in terminal, replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with actual authtoken.
   
   ```sh
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

## Before you run the Application

 1. Make sure that `.env` file has correct info and it has been saved in the root directory.
 2. Make sure that you have set the system variables correctly.
 3. Make sure that you have updated the Priority Level IDs in `webhook_listener.py` line 12.
 4. Make sure that ngrok is configured correctly

   
## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```sh
   python -u webhook_listener.py
   ```
2. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
   ```sh
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
3. Running the above command will give you a public url, copy that url and replace it in the place of `<your-ngrok-url>` at line 5 of `.env` and save the file.

4. In a new terminal, create the webhook:
   ```sh
   python -u create_webhook.py
   ```

## Testing
1. Create tasks in your Asana project
2. Assign different priority levels to tasks
3. Move tasks to the "In Progress" section
4. Verify that due dates are being set and updated according to the rules
5. Remove the high priority task from In Progress section
6. Verify that due dates of tasks in 'In Progress' section gets reduced
7. Verify that no duplicate due date extensions and reductions are being made
